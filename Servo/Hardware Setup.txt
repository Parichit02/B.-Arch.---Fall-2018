Without using actuator interface boards, there is a small degree of hacking involved in the setup.
The following steps would enable the setup for the servo:

1. Strip one end of the 6P cable (other end connected to a 6P jack). White cable transmits power, black is data (output from the HCDM) and blue is ground (See image). Cut the other wires. 
2. Connect the wires to the servo input. For the servo - Orange is data , Red is power and brown is ground
3. Upload Servo.ino. (There is a built in library for the servo)
4. Watch in amazement! 

The tricky part here is to ensure that the intermediate connection made (shown in setup.png) is correct. Under no circumstance should the power and ground be connected.
Use tape/heat shrink to separate out the two components.
