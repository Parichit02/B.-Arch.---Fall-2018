So far, the actuation was done using the delay function. 
Use of the delay function is not ideal for our application. 
When the teensy is executing the delay function, it isn't capable of doing anything else. Thus, if we receive IR triggers or a message from a neighboring teensy, it won't be able to detect it.
As shown in https://github.com/Parichit02/B.-Arch.---Fall-2018/tree/master/Workshop_Chain_reaction_with_Delay
The Teensy is capable of receiving triggers and messages from other teensies simultaneuously as well.

Thus, we switch over to a frame-by-frame approach. Here, the actuation value is determined at each frame. The actuators are then set at the actuation level at each frame.
In the code here, each frame is 1 ms. Every frame, the actuator is set at its new actuation PWM level. 

Video exhibit attached here shows the final result of the work.
